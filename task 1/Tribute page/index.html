                <p>
                    On 25 April 2014, Mukund led a cordon and search operation in a village in South Kashmir, based on intelligence inputs regarding the presence of militants. 
                    During the operation, his team came under heavy fire.
                     Mukund quickly responded, aware that the cover of darkness could allow the militants to escape.
                      Since the number of civilians inside the house was unclear, the use of heavy-caliber weapons was not an option.
                     Along with Sepoy Vikram Singh, Mukund crawled through the orchard in front of the house, avoiding gunfire.
                      After successfully crossing the orchard, they entered the house, where they were met with intense firing, and Mukund was grazed by a bullet on his forearm.
                       The two soldiers swiftly retaliated, killing one of the militants. Mukund identified that the militant commander they were searching for was not among the dead. 
                       The remaining two militants, including a senior commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, attempted to escape using grenade explosions. 
                       Mukund and Singh took cover to avoid injury. In the chaos, Mukund recognized the senior commander among the fleeing militants as they made their way to the nearby outhouse.            </div>
